# Serialization & Deserialization

## Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Serialization is used to persist the state of an object. The object can be reconstructed later by deserialization.

Serialization is used in many situations. For example, when you want to save the state of an object to a file, or when you want to send an object over the network.

## Deserialization

Deserialization is the process of converting a sequence of bits back into a data structure or object.

Deserialization is the process of reconstructing an object from its serialized form.

Deserialization is the opposite of serialization.

## Serialization in Python

Python provides a built-in module called `pickle` for serializing and deserializing objects.

Example:

```python
import pickle


```
